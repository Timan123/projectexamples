Some web applications I solely wrote.  construction pulls together 4 disparate sources of information with sync scripts, makes sense of it with a nice UI. ipaddr is a very ops oriented project, lots of Command scripts. tim4 is a telco billing app, more complex UI and business logic. fiber.zip is a newer application written in Laravel 5 and Vue.js, uploading it in archive form was more convenient.  DesignExample.png is a screenshot example of a more complex UI with tabs and pagination.
