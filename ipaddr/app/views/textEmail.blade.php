Cogent Communications - Important Contract Notice

To StrikeIron, Inc:
Dear Valued Cogent Customer,

Cogent has changed the way we allocate IPv4 address space to our customers. Due to the increasing scarcity of public IPv4 addresses, there was a need for a more sustainable management of this scarce resource. As a result, Cogent customers using more than 8 IPv4 addresses (/29) per port incur since August 2015 a monthly recurring fee. Unless the attached Product Rider describing this policy already applies to your contract, we are hereby notifying you of this contract change.

For "Legacy" IPv4 address allocations (i.e., allocated to you by Cogent before August 2015), we have deferred implementation of these fees until July 1, 2016. We wanted to give you adequate time to evaluate your IPv4 usage and, if necessary, to take appropriate actions, whether that includes giving back IPv4 addresses you feel you do not need or reconfiguring your network. For your convenience, we have included a list of your current Legacy IPv4 address allocations below (which were provided with your port order numbers {{$orderString}}).

IPv4 Addresses:
@foreach($addresses as $address)
{{$address['Address']}}
@endforeach

These IPv4 address allocations will now be included under a single new order number: 1-XXXXXXXXX. Discounting your one free /29 per port, your allocations come to a total count of 4,064 IPv4 addresses, for which we will be charging you a monthly recurring fee of $1219.20 USD beginning on July 1, 2016. Should you wish to return any IPv4 addresses to avoid or reduce these fees, please let us know before June 1, 2016 by sending an email to terms@cogentco.com. You can also notify us any time thereafter &#45; billing for an IPv4 address allocation order that you terminate will stop 30 days after the end of the month of its notification date.
