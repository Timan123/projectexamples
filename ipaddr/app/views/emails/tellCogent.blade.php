You are receiving this email because you are the active account manager for this customer. We wanted to give you a heads up that this customer will receive an email from Cogent Billing today, notifying them of charges for legacy IPv4 address allocations (i.e., IPv4 allocated by Cogent to the customer prior to August 2015). This is part of a test run for just very few customers.
<br><br>
You will receive a blind copy of the notification email, or you can click on the link below to view the email. It shows the count of legacy IPv4 addresses, the related MRC and the bill start date for their legacy IPV4ALLOC order, which was automatically created in our systems. 
<br><br>
No action is required from your end, unless the customer contacts you with questions related to legacy IPv4 addresses, in which case you should:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;- either direct customer to Billing, if they have general questions - http://cogentco.com/en/customer-service/faq#contact_billing <br>
&emsp;&emsp;- or direct customer to Retention, if they want to give back IPv4 addresses:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For North America and Asia Pac: renewals@cogentco.com or +1-877-875-3310 or +1-703-456-7692<br>
